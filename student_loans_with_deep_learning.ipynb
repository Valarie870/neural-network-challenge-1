Describe the data that you would need to collect to build a recommendation system to recommend student loan options for students. Explain why this data would be relevant and appropriate.\n","\n","Response: Data needed to collect would consist of demographics such as age, residency status (domestic or international), education including degree type (undergrad/bachelor or graduate/master), field of study (engineering, education, humanities), current education status (freshman, senior), anticipated graduation date, financial information (household income, employment status if possible, existing debt), credit score, and desired loan amount.\n","\n","This data would be relevant because these attributes factor into the likelihood of a loan repayment and how you could strucuture the terms. For example, someone who is a freshman would likely not start repaying until after graduation, whereas someone who is a senior would likely be able to start repayment quicker. Also, field of study can be taken into account as some fields such as engineering may offer more job opportunities or higher earning potential compared to jobs in art history.\n","\n","2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model be using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your choice of filtering method.\n","\n","Response: My model would use Content-based filtering because it would focus on matching a user's/student's attributes with loan options. This would enable the different attributes (features) to personalize recommendations. Also, loan specific items such as interest rates, repayment terms, can be matched to the student's needs/profile. This would allow for a more personalized experienced that would lead to better engagement and more likelihood of repayment because you would have direct correlation of attributes between loan offerings and student profiles.\n","\n","3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.\n","\n","Response: One real-world challenge to take into consideration would be bias, as models can \"expand\" on biases in training data, and the biases can lead to discrimination in loan offerings. This could lead to students from lower income households being offered higher interest rates compared to those from other households.\n","\n","Another real-world challenge would be market conditions, as interest rates fluctuate and government regulations change, impacting the Federal Reserve Rate, which impacts interest rates overall. If data is not current, loan options may not align to current conditions or interest rates. This could be misleading for students as they think they are getting one rate, but then end up with another. This could also affect the organization as students and others may not be able to put their \"trust\" in the organization.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"wQFMgLAdmGSR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1741284556424,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Valarie Miller","userId":"06015720210842094327"}}},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
